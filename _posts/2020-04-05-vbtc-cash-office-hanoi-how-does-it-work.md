## VBTC Cash Office in Hanoi - How does it work?

If you have been following our recent [Social Media](https://twitter.com/VBTC_Vietnam/status/1241217785486688258 "Social Media") [announcements](https://www.facebook.com/VBTC.vn/photos/a.597546860357441/2583897775055663/ "announcements"), you might have seen that besides our Cash Office in HCMC we recently also opened up a funding / withdrawal method for Hanoi residents who do not have bank accounts and/or otherwise prefer to remain unbanked when dealing with Bitcoin.

If you are interested in utilizing this service, we made a small guidance graphic which hopefully will help you navigate the process - but as always feel free to reach out to our customer service team via the common channels to receive support otherwise if you have any additional questions.

Your Team VBTC
