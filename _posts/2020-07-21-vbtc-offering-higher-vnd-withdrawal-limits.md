## VBTC offering higher VND withdrawal limits

VBTC is from this month on offering higher VND bank withdrawal limits to all its user levels.

From now on, unverified users are able to withdraw up to 100m VND per transaction.

Verified users (Level 1/2/3) will be able to withdraw unlimited amounts of VND to their bank accounts.

The withdrawal limits to our Cash Offices in Ho Chi Minh City and [Hanoi](https://blog.vbtc.exchange/2020/vbtc-cash-office-hanoi-how-does-it-work) are unaffected by this measure.
